Welcome to the Data Toolkit module! üëã
Over the next three units, we will cover the fundamental tools that any Data Scientist or Data Analyst uses daily.

Data Analysis
Say ‚Äúbye‚Äù to VS Code (for now), and ‚Äúhello‚Äù to Jupyter Notebook - an IDE that allows you to add code, comments, visualizations, and images inline, making it a great tool for data analysis and exploration
Speed up your data operations thanks to vectorized computations and the NumPy Python library
Start learning the analytical and data manipulation capabilities of Pandas, one of the most widely used Python data libraries
Data Sourcing in Pandas
Learn to utilize the Pandas sourcing and parsing toolkit
Work with a wide range of data sources like CSV, API, SQL & Google BigQuery databases, and web scraping
Extract patterns from text data using regular expressions
Data Visualization
Get to know Matplotlib, the Python library for data visualization that is the ‚Äúancestor‚Äù to many other Python plotting libraries
Learn different types of plots and their use cases, from the basics like line charts, bar charts, and scatterplots, all the way to dynamic maps, ridgeline plots, and more
Practice using higher-level Python visualization libraries like Seaborn and Plotly, allowing you to plot more diverse charts, faster
