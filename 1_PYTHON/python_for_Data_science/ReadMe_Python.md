Welcome to the Python module, the first module of the bootcamp! üëã
This module is designed to teach you how to use what is probably the most important tool for any Data Scientist: Python! üêç

Knowing how to write code in Python is essential because every tool from data analysis & visualization to Machine Learning & Deep Learning uses Python to achieve results. If you imagine that these tools and packages are machines that you can configure and adjust by turning screws, then Python is the master screwdriver to help you do it! Below is an overview of all the units in this module.

Python for Data Science
We start with the basics of Python. Variables, conditionals, loops, lists, and dicts are just a few of your new best friends moving forward. You will learn the main concepts surrounding both Python and coding as a general skill, and then build up from there.

Data Sourcing
In this unit, you take your first steps into the world of data collection. This is where you learn how to collect data - which can be a complex topic - from various sources, such as CSV files, APIs (Application Programming Interface), and through scraping websites. As we often say in the world of Data Science, garbage in, garbage out, so knowing how to collect quality data is a must.

SQL Basics & Advanced
The two last units of the module are dedicated to teaching you how to leverage the most common form of data storage: databases. Using SQLite as an example, you will add SQL (Structured Query Language) to your toolkit to enable you to talk with databases. As mentioned above, quality data is a must, so knowing how to query data from and store it in relational databases is extremely important!
