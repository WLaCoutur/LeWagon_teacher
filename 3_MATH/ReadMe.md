Welcome to the Maths module! ðŸ§®
This module has two main topics: Algebra & Calculus and Statistics & Probabilities. The goal for this module is to give you some foundational knowledge of the part of Maths that is most important for Data Science as a whole, but more importantly for Decision Science (module 4), Machine Learning (module 5), and Deep Learning (module 6).

While this is not a heavily theoretical Maths course, it can get tricky in certain areas, so donâ€™t hesitate to rely on your Teacher and TAs for help if you need it!
