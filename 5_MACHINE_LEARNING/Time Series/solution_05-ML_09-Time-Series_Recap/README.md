## 🚀 Introduction to Darts: A Time Series Library 📚
This Jupyter notebook is a quickstart guide to using Darts, a user-friendly Python library designed for time series analysis and forecasting. Darts integrates seamlessly with the pandas library, provides a broad range of time series manipulation tools, and features intuitive visualization capabilities. This notebook is a useful resource for anyone interested in exploring and modeling temporal patterns.

### 🚧 Set-up
Please note that Darts does not yet support the M1/M2 chip. Therefore, it is recommended to run this notebook on Google Colab if you are using such architecture.

### 📝 Sections:


### 📊 Loading and Visualizing Time Series Data with Pandas and Darts:

We cover the loading of time series datasets such as weather and ice cream searches data from Google Trends. We'll also show the creation of a Darts TimeSeries object from a pandas DataFrame and the visualization of the time series using Darts' capabilities.

### 🔄 Manipulating Time Series Data:

Here we show various operations for manipulating time series data, including:

- Resampling and frequency conversion
- Handling missing values
- Applying rolling window calculations
- Feature engineering

### ⏳ Time Series Modeling and Forecasting:
Here we fit various models to time series data and generating forecasts. We cover the implementation of:

- Naive models (e.g., NaiveSeasonal)
- Classical models (e.g., ExponentialSmoothing)
- Machine learning models (e.g., Prophet, ARIMA)

### 🧮 Multiple Models and Covariates:

Finally, we'll demonstrate how to use multiple models and covariates to improve forecasting.
