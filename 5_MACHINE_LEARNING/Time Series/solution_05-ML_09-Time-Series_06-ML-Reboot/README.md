### 🚀 Welcome to the Machine Learning Reboot Challenge! 🚀

This notebook is designed to be a simple refresher on a lot of the core concepts you've picked up over the past 1.5 weeks of ML learning. In it, you'll go over the following topics and be quizzed on them all as you go:

🧹 Data Cleaning 🧹
Practice your pandas thoroughly to clean and pre-process the Airbnb dataset.

🚦 Train-Test Split 🚦
Go over the methodology for splitting up our data correctly.

📈 Linear Regression 📈
Explore the fundamentals of linear regression and use it to make predictions on the Airbnb data.

🌐 Random Forest Regressor 🌐
Try a random forest regression and build a more robust predictive model.

🔁 Cross-Validation 🔁
Revise cross-validation for estimating model performance.

🎯 Logistic Regression 🎯
Shift gears and explore logistic regression for classification tasks in some airline data.

🏢 K-Means Clustering for NY Boroughs 🏢
Practice unsupervised learning by applying K-means clustering to group Airbnb listings in NYC


To get started, open the notebook `ML_reboot.ipynb` You can work on any section you like, and each task is followed by questions to test your understanding.

Good luck 🎉


📝 P.S. Ignore the "test_answers.py" file. It is used for checking answers programmatically at the end of the notebook.
