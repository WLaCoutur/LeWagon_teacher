    "1Ô∏è‚É£ CI - Continuous Integration\n",
    "Continuous integration is the practice of integrating all your code changes into the main branch of a shared source code repository early and often, automatically testing each change when you commit or merge them, and automatically kicking off a build.\n",
    "CI workflows are\n",
    "triggered either by a git event such as a PR merge or a commit, or on schedule\n",
    "running on dedicated, isolated, and fresh environments\n",
    "responsible for building artifacts, running your test suites, and reporting any anomalies\n",
    "Examples: GitHub Actions, Gitlab, Jenkins, Travis, Buildkite, CircleCI\n",
    "GitHub Actions\n",
    "GitHub Actions make it easy to automate all your software workflows as it integrates perfectly with GitHub without any configuration effort on the developer‚Äôs side\n",
    "‚úÖ Plus, it‚Äôs free for public GitHub repositories!\n",
    "A few details to consider:\n",
    "An event can be any git action (push, new branch, etc.) but also any GitHub-specific event\n",
    "Only events on your remote GitHub repository will be considered; if you commit on your local machine but do not push, nothing will be triggered\n",
    "An action can be really anything: shell command, another GitHub Action, etc.\n",
    "Documentation\n",
    "Getting ready\n",
    "Let's set the stage first. Create an empty folder and initialize it as a repo; this will be our sample repository to work from. Then, we need to create a few other things to use with our GHA.\n",
