Welcome to the Decision Science module! üéâ
Here we will work on our first mini-project. For this mini-project, we will be looking at Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace that provided the public with a dataset containing real information surrounding all the orders made on the platform in the last few years. The overall goal is to try and answer one guiding question: how do we increase customer satisfaction (and with it our profit margin) while maintaining a healthy volume of orders?

To answer that question, we will look at several different topics that together will enable us to conduct quality analysis on Olist‚Äôs data.

Project Setup
Plain and simple, you can‚Äôt work well if you don‚Äôt have a proper setup. Therefore, this module is meant to guide you in creating a robust setup for you to work with so that you can fully focus on the actual analysis.

Statistical Inference
As the name implies, statistical inference is all about inferring values based on a limited sample of observations. We will learn how to leverage probabilities and mathematical theorems (see module 3) to try and understand how to extrapolate data from limited samples of observations, as accurately as we can.

Linear Regression
Linear Regression (LinReg for short) builds on the concept of statistical inference to help us understand how features are influenced by one another. In essence, LinReg will show us linear correlations (mathematically speaking) between our features.

Logistic Regression
What to do when features do not have a straightforward linear correlation? Use Logistic Regression instead! Here, ‚Äúlogistic‚Äù comes from log, and that is what will enable us to understand correlations that are not linear, and therefore more complex to model.

Communicate
To close this module, we learn how to communicate all of our findings effectively. It sounds easy, but there is a lot that goes into properly communicating data! Everything from the kind of plot you use to how you present your notebook influences how people will perceive and interpret your analysis, and this is what we learn here.
