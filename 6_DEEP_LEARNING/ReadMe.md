Welcome to Deep Learning! üß†
The Deep Learning (DL) module is a complex but very interesting one. Everything from image/video/audio recognition to car safety systems (automatic braking, cruise control, lane assist, etc.) can be found under DL‚Äôs huge umbrella, and we‚Äôll take you through some of it over the next 5 units.

Deep Learning Basics
In this unit, we want to give you some basic concepts of DL so that you have a high-level understanding of what DL is. More importantly, you will learn about the one central structure that governs Deep Learning: the neural network.

Optimizer, Loss & Fitting
Once you‚Äôve been armed with the first tools to handle neural networks (NNs), we want to further expand your toolkit by showing you how to fine-tune your NNs so that they can be used efficiently to achieve the results you need! Among others, you will then be able to apply that knowledge in a challenge that shows you how to leverage the power of NNs to detect credit card fraud.

Convolutional Neural Networks
This is where we take things to the next level by teaching you about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). If you were waiting for image recognition, this is it! CNNs are mostly responsible for processing and ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù images, which can be used for automatic caption generation or facial recognition, among other things. You will learn about things like kernels and convolutions, which are the main mechanisms used by CNNs.

Recurrent Neural Networks & Natural Language Processing
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) deal with problems that have sequential data as an input. Once we‚Äôve covered them, we‚Äôll see how they can be apply to text (sequences of words!) for NLP.

Natural Language Processing
In this unit, we dive into Transformers to see the advanced architectures that are possible with them.
